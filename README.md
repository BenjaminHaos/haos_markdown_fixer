# haos_markdown_fixer

An attempt at solving a problem...

I want spell-check in my Cloud9 editor, especially with markdown.

These all have features that might be useful but none work exactly as i'd like.

This would be the best setup,
* [ALM Tools for TypeScript](http://alm.tools/)

But it needs an interface more like these,
* [CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net/)
* [StackEdit – In-browser markdown editor](https://stackedit.io/)
* [Classeur – Re-enjoy writing, with Markdown](http://classeur.io/)

*to be continued*
